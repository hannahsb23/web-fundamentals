    <h2>Hi, I'm Hannah!</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Hannah, and I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho. I am working toward a degree in computer science and am interested in teaching high school computer science in the future. I have explored a few different career paths, but I always found myself coming back to education.

    <p>
        I enjoy hiking, reading, and traveling whenever I get the chance. I love learning new things and enjoy problem-solving, which is one of the reasons I am excited to learn more about web design and development in this course.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am taking this class to better understand how websites are built and how I can use these skills both personally and professionally. I believe learning HTML and web design will be valuable whether I am working in education or another technology-related field in the future.
